<h3>What Is a collection?</h3>
<p>
  A collection is a series of small items that you wish to communicate about. This isn't limited to things
  in this site as it's typically a way of showcasing work or linking off to resources. This design can also
  be used as a template for making small showcases of work and adding additional pages into the mix.

<h3>How do users engage with these items?</h3>
<p>
  Users will click on items in the list to jump off to pages elsewhere. You could use this to
  link to a portfolio of work, an index of content created that is non-linear, showcase work, 
  or anything you like! This is just boilerplate to generate ideas!
