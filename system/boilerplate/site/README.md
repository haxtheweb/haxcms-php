# HAXsite
This is a HAXcms generated and managed micro-site. It can run on it's own but it was generated by a HAXcms system somewhere. https://github.com/haxtheweb/haxcms-nodejs is probably what you want in most instance however if you are deploying single sites using a upstream hosting provider it's possible you still want to use this for deploying from.

Run this via node:
- `npx @haxtheweb/haxcms-nodejs` - to run this locally
- `npm init @haxtheweb` - to run this and work on other things

## Developer mode
Most people will want to use https://github.com/haxtheweb/create if you are a developer however you might be curious what this package is as a stand alone thing so we won't deny you.

### special note
The CDN mirrors for HAXcms may or may not include the elements you wish to extend your project with so those options for rapid distributed publishing may not be availble.

HAXcms seeks to be the smallest possible back-end CMS to make HAX work and be able to build websites with it. Leveraging JSON Outline Schema, HAX is able to author multiple pages, which it then writes onto the file system.
